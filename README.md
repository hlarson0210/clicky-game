# clicky-game
## Application
This application is an introduction into `react` & the `react` environment.

## How to Use
This is a memory application - the goal is to click on all the cards without a duplicate click to a card. The application will render a stack of cards to the screen in a random order, on each click of a card the application will randomly shuffle the display of the cards. If you have not clicked that card before, your score will increase and that specific card will be have an updated state of clicked. Continue guessing until you have guessed all the cards correctly. If you guess the same card twice the game will restart!
